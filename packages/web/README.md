# @feed-platform/web

React frontend for the feed aggregation platform.

## Features

- **Feed View**: Display feeds generated by algorithms
- **Algorithm Editor**: Create and edit algorithm configurations in YAML
- **Source Manager**: Add and manage content sources (RSS, HN, Reddit, Webhooks)
- **Notifications**: View and manage webhook notifications
- **Algorithm Marketplace**: Browse and install community algorithms

## Tech Stack

- React 18
- TypeScript
- Vite
- React Router
- TanStack Query (React Query)
- React Hot Toast
- Axios

## Setup

### Installation

```bash
npm install
```

### Environment Variables

Create `.env.local`:

```bash
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:3001/api
```

If not set, defaults to `/api` (using Vite proxy).

### Development

```bash
npm run dev
```

App runs at `http://localhost:5173`

The dev server is configured to proxy `/api` requests to the backend at `http://localhost:3001`.

### Production

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

## Pages

- Edit existing algorithms
- Delete algorithms
- View all saved algorithms

### Source Manager (`/sources`)
- Add content sources (RSS, Hacker News, Reddit, Webhooks)

- Manually fetch content
- Fetch from all sources
- Delete sources

### Notifications (`/notifications`)

## API Integration

All API calls go through the centralized `services/api.ts` module:

```typescript
import { feedApi, algorithmApi, sourceApi } from './services/api';

// Get feed
const feed = await feedApi.getFeed(algorithmId);

// Create algorithm
const algo = await algorithmApi.create(yamlConfig);

// Fetch from source
await sourceApi.fetch(sourceId);
```
